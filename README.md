This project is done in my junior year for Signal Processing project. The aim of the project is to Detect key pressed in Mobile from the tone generated by it while dialing.

This project is Implemented in MATLAB.

Content:

1. generate_tone.m -- For generating tones of any frequency

2. goertzel_algo.m -- Implementation of goertzel algorithm for detecting power of particular frequency in any sequence.
